# Go Implementation of the Envoz API

Envoz is a side project of mine that I use for managing invoices for freelance work. 

The purpose of this Golang implementation is to learn Go REST API Development using Mux (router), Gorm (ORM), and Golang development in general. The application is optimized for Heroku deployment using go Go Build Kit and Godep for dependency management.



# Installing and running

To run using Gin: `gun run main.go`

To run using Go: `go run *.go`

Gin is my preferred method for running the application locally as it will watch your files for changes and automatically re-rerun the application.
